# Email Validation in JavaScript

Email validation is an essential aspect of user input verification in web applications. Ensuring that users provide accurate and properly formatted email addresses helps maintain data integrity and provides a better user experience. In this repository, we demonstrate how to validate email addresses using JavaScript with the help of regular expressions.

## Introduction

When users submit data through HTML forms, it is crucial to validate the input on the client side before sending it to the server. Email addresses are one of the most common fields requiring validation. An email address typically consists of two parts separated by the "@" symbol: the user's identity and the domain name at which the email is registered. Ensuring the correctness of the user's input before submission helps prevent unnecessary server requests and enhances the overall user experience.

## Email Validation

In this repository, we use regular expressions to validate email addresses. Regular expressions are powerful patterns that allow us to match and manipulate strings efficiently. The regular expression used for email validation in this example checks for the following format:

```javascript
/^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/
```

- The pattern starts with `^` to indicate the beginning of the string.
- `([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}` matches the user's identity, allowing alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots. The `{1,}` ensures there is at least one character in this group.
- `\@` matches the "@" symbol literally.
- `([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}` matches the domain name, following similar rules as the user's identity.
- `\.` matches the dot (.) literally.
- `([A-Za-z]{2,4})` matches the top-level domain (TLD), allowing two to four alphabetic characters.
- The pattern ends with `$` to indicate the end of the string.

## Getting Started

To use this email validation in your web application, follow these steps:

1. Install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code on your computer.
2. Create a new HTML file in your project.
3. Copy the code from the "Code Example" section and paste it inside the `<script>` tag in your HTML file.
4. Save the file and run it from your file location to see the validation in action.

## Code Example

Below is the JavaScript code for email validation:

```javascript
function validateEmail() {
  var reg = /^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]){1,}\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/;
  var address = document.getElementById('Email').value;

  if (reg.test(address) == false) {
    alert("Email not valid");
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

This code defines a function `validateEmail()` that checks if the input email address matches the regular expression pattern. If the address is not valid, it displays an alert message indicating that the email is invalid.

## Testing Environment

The code in this repository was created and tested in Visual Studio Code version 1.73.1. While it may work in other versions as well, be mindful of any changes when using different code editors.
